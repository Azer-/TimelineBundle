==========================

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/stephpy/TimelineBundle.png)](http://travis-ci.org/stephpy/TimelineBundle)

Build timeline/wall for an entity easily.

There is too a notification system, you can easily know how many unread notifications you have, mark as read one/all, etc ... You can too add your notifier easily ...

Actually depends on **SncRedisBundle**.
