Build timeline/wall for an entity easily.

There is too a notification system, you can easily know how many unread notifications you have, mark as read one/all, etc ... You can too add your notifier easily ...

Actually depends on **SncRedisBundle**.

---------------

# Wishlist

- Other providers ( contribute guys !)
- Propel/Doctrine ODM supports

# Todo

- Move Doctrine Entity to super class to let user be able to override it.

- Be able to pass options to filters (we should define filters as tag too)
